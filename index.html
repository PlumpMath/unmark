    and throwing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not
    only a civil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking
    at him a moment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole a
    clean, comely looking cannibal. What's all this fuss I have been
    making about, thought I to myselfâ€”the man's a human being just as
    I am: he has just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be
    afraid of him. Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken
    Christian.</p><p> "Landlord," said I, "tell him to stash his
    tomahawk there, or pipe, or whatever you call it; tell him to stop
    smoking, in short, and I will turn in with him. But I don't fancy
    having a man smoking in bed with me. It's dangerous. Besides, I
    ain't insured."</p></p></p><p><h2>Tools I Use</h2><p><h3>Clojure</h3><p><span>Biltong capicola tri-tip strip steak sirloin
